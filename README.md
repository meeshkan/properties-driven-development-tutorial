This repository contains the source code for our tutorial: [Introduction to properties-driven development](https://meeshkan.com/blog/introduction-to-properties-driven-development/).

Most of the tests are written with [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for generative test cases.

If you run into problems or have any questions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/meeshkan/properties-driven-development-tutorial/issues) or [reach out to us on Gitter](https://gitter.im/meeshkan/community).
